# CSF425 Deep Learning Project

## Description

For running the testing_code_template.py file, kindly follow the steps below

1. Change directory to the project folder
```cd DLProject-folder```

2. Install dependencies using requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set the TEST_DATA_DIRECTORY_ABSOLUTE_PATH & OUTPUT_CSV_ABSOLUTE_PATH variables to absolute paths of test directory and where you want the output.csv to be created

4. Both model architectures are instantiated in the file. Currently, the uncommented evaluate uses the first architecture and the evaluate passing the second architecture is commented. Uncomment the evaluate line passing model_architecture2 and comment the one with model_architecture1 if you want to test the second architecture.
